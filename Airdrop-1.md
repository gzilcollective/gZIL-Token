## 🎉 Thank You, gZIL Community!
The gZIL Collective launched last January, and thanks to your support — especially those who voted — we want to say:

**We see you. We appreciate you. We are rewarding participation.**

### 🙌 Why This Matters
When an initiative like ours begins, community support is everything. You showed up for governance, helped shape decisions, and that matters — because it shapes the future of the gZIL Collective.

### 🎁 Participation Rewards
To recognize your contributions, we’re sending a total of 500,000 ZIL to 65 addresses that voted in at least one of the last two gZIL Collective voting rounds.

Rewards per address range from 2,500 ZIL to 27,500 ZIL

### 🗳️ Looking Ahead: Season 2
This isn’t just about one-time rewards — it’s about ongoing participation. Every vote counts.

If you're a gZIL holder, voting is the clearest way to make your voice heard
