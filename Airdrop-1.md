## 🎉 Thank You, gZIL Community!
The gZIL Collective launched last January, and thanks to your support — especially those who voted — we want to say:

**We see you. We appreciate you. We are rewarding participation.**

### 🙌 Why This Matters
When an initiative like ours begins, community support is everything. You showed up for governance, helped shape decisions, and that matters — because it shapes the future of the gZIL Collective.

### 🎁 Participation Rewards
To recognize your contributions, we’re sending a total of 500,000 ZIL to 65 addresses that voted in at least one of the last two gZIL Collective voting rounds.

Rewards per address range from 2,500 ZIL to 27,500 ZIL

### 🗳️ Looking Ahead: Season 2
This isn’t just about one-time rewards — it’s about ongoing participation. Every vote counts.

If you're a gZIL holder, voting is the clearest way to make your voice heard

### 🧮 Reward Breakdown by Tier
Here's a breakdown of the reward structure:

| Tier   | Min gZIL | Max gZIL | # of Addresses | Allocation % | Reward ZIL per Address |
|--------|----------|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Tier 1 | 0.01     | 20       | 16             | 8.00%         | 2,500                   |
| Tier 2 | 21       | 300      | 25             | 15.00%        | 3,000                   |
| Tier 3 | 301      | 800      | 7              | 18.00%        | 12,857.14               |
| Tier 4 | 801      | 2800     | 11             | 26.00%        | 11,818.18               |
| Tier 5 | 2801     | 20000    | 6              | 33.00%        | 27,500                  |

**Total Distribution:**
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Addresses Rewarded: **65**
- 💸 Total ZIL Sent: **500,000**

### 📝 Justification for Current gZIL Reward Tiering and Snapshot-Based Distribution
**1. Encouraging Participation Across All Levels**
- Tier 1 and Tier 2 include the largest number of addresses, ensuring that smaller holders are not excluded from rewards.
- These tiers receive meaningful ZIL allocations, reinforcing the principle that every gZIL holder contributes to the network’s decentralization and vitality.

**2. Rewarding Strategic Commitment**
- Tier 3 and Tier 4 represent mid-to-high gZIL holders who have demonstrated deeper commitment to the ecosystem.
- Though Tier 4’s ZIL per gZIL is lower than Tier 3, this reflects a broader range of gZIL holdings and a larger address pool — distributing rewards more evenly across a diverse cohort.
- This tier acts as a stabilizing middle ground, ensuring that rewards don’t disproportionately favour either end of the spectrum.

**3. Preserving Incentives for Long-Term Stakeholders**
- Tier 5 holders represent the most significant governance participants. Their higher ZIL reward per address acknowledges their outsized influence and long-term investment.
- Their allocation ensures that strategic stakeholders remain engaged and aligned with the network’s future — without monopolising the reward pool.

**4. Balancing Equity and Influence**
- The tier structure avoids a purely linear reward curve, which could dilute incentives for larger holders or over-reward small ones.
- Instead, it uses a convex reward model — modest rewards for small holders, a steep increase for mid-tier, and a tapering rise for whales — to reflect both stake size and network impact.

### ⚙️ Technical Constraints and Snapshot-Based Distribution
Due to current limitations in infrastructure, we’ve adopted a simplified and pragmatic approach to reward distribution:
- Zilliqa has transitioned to EVM-compatible addresses, but gZIL remains a ZRC-2 token on the original chain.
- Blockscout, the primary EVM block explorer, does not yet support reporting ZRC-2 token balances for ZIL-native addresses.
- Viewblock, the legacy explorer, is currently misreporting gZIL holdings, making real-time verification unreliable.
- To ensure fairness and transparency, we’ve chosen to base rewards on gZIL holdings at the time of the Snapshot vote, which was publicly recorded and verifiable.
- ZIL rewards will be distributed to the associated EVM accounts, maintaining continuity with the network’s transition and ensuring accessibility for all participants.
